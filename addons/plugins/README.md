# Plugins

**WIP**

Plugins offer the possibility to use external programs and tools to enhance a Unimarkup implementation.

**There are two options:**

1. Provide additional field names

   In this case, the content inside those field blocks/boxes is forwarded to the external program or tool. The resulting content must then be valid Unimarkup.

2. Provide additional macros

   In this case, the parameter values are forwarded to the external program or tool. The resulting content must then be valid Unimarkup.
