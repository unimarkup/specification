# Markup

This folder defines the syntax for Unimarkup markup.
The definition is split in several folders that group similar Unimarkup elements.

Rendering of Unimarkup elements is defined per [output format](/output-formats/README.md).


**Note:** To prevent stack exhaustion, implementations may limit the number of allowed recursive macro calls, nesting depth of elements, and number of cycles per loop.
