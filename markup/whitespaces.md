# Whitespaces

Any whitespace sequence without blank lines in plain text that is not escaped must be compressed to one space.

## Empty line

A line is considered empty if it only consists of whitespaces.

## Blank line

A blank line consists of one or more subsequent empty lines.

**Note:** Multiple blank lines must be treated as one blank line.
