# Enclosed blocks

**WIP**

This section contains enclosed block elements.
Enclosed blocks have start and end keywords that must start at a new line.
Both start and end keywords must have the same length, with a minimum keyword length of three. 
The inner content may then start at the beginning of the line after the start keyword. The start and end keyword lines count as blank lines for inner block elements.

To nest enclosed blocks that allow nesting, the outer keywords must be at least one grapheme longer than the inner ones.

Attributes may be set directly after the start keyword without any whitespace between.

**Type:** All enclosed block elements are part of the `enclosed-block` type.
