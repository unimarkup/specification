# Section break

A section break is set with three or more `:`.
The behavior of a section break depends on the enclosed element it is used in.
This behavior must be defined in the description section of each enclosed element. 

If it is not inside an enclosed element, it must behave like a page break.
How a page break is rendered may depend on the output format.
 
**Usage:**

```
Page 1

:::

Page 2
```

**Type:** `section-break`
