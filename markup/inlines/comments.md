# Comments

Comments in Unimarkup are started with `;;`.
A comment automatically ends at the end of a line, but may be manually closed by setting `;;` again.

**Note:** It is not possible to have a backslash at the end of a line to get an explicit new line if a comment is not closed.

**Usage:**

```
;; comment to end of line

A comment may be ;; end of line comment
at the end of a line

Comment ;;this is a comment;; inside one line.
```

**Type:** `comment`
