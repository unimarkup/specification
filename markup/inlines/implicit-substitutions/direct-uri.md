# Direct URI

**WIP**

A part of plain text content that would be a valid URI, and is only surrounded by whitespace or punctuation graphemes, must be treated as a link.

**Note:** It is not possible to set attributes to a direct URI.

**Usage:**

```
https://github.com

https://github.com.
```

**Type:** `direct-uri`
