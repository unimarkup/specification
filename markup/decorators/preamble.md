# Preamble

A preamble is an optional block that may be set at the beginning of a Unimarkup file.
It may be used to set file configurations as defined in the [configuration](/configuration/README) section.
The syntax is like the one for [block decorations](/markup/decorators/block-decoration).

The content inside the preamble must be set using [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/).

**Example:**

```
+++
title: "Unimarkup specification"
+++

Some Unimarkup content.
```
