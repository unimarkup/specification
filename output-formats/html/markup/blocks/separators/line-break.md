# Line break

**WIP**

A line break has two different output variants for the HTML output format.

1. Used as column break inside an explicit column

  This is defined in the [explicit column](/output-formats/html/markup/blocks/enclosed/columns/explicit-column.md) section.

2. Used as regular page break

  ```
  :::
  ```
  
  renders to 
  
  ````html
  <br/>
  ```
